# Hotel Maintenance Management System (HMMS) - Blockchain Solution

## Overview

The Hotel Maintenance Management System (HMMS) is a blockchain-based solution designed to optimize the maintenance operations for hospitality properties. By leveraging smart contracts on a blockchain network, this system ensures transparency, accountability, and efficiency in managing hotel room maintenance tasks.

## Core Components

### Property Verification Contract
This smart contract validates and authenticates legitimate accommodation providers, ensuring that only authorized properties can participate in the network. It serves as the foundation for trust within the ecosystem.

### Room Status Contract
This contract maintains a real-time ledger of room conditions, automatically tracking cleanliness levels and repair needs. Each room's status is immutably recorded, allowing for transparent reporting and analysis.

### Maintenance Assignment Contract
This contract manages the creation and assignment of work orders to appropriate maintenance staff. It tracks task allocation, priorities, deadlines, and resource management.

### Quality Verification Contract
This contract confirms the satisfactory completion of maintenance tasks through a multi-stakeholder verification process. It ensures that work meets quality standards before closing work orders.
